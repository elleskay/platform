# @platform/spec-test

Spec-driven test runner. Validates a YAML spec, registers `specTest(id, title, fn)` calls in Vitest and Playwright, records pass/fail per ID, and gates CI on 100% coverage.

## What this catches

- Missing test for any spec ID → coverage report flags it, CLI exits 1.
- Test exists but body is empty (zero `expect()` calls) → ESLint rule fails before tests run.
- Test exists in the wrong test layer (e.g. a `category: ui` requirement only covered by a Vitest test instead of Playwright) → category mismatch, exit 1.
- Test exists and fails → standard runner failure, exit 1.

Run on every PR. CI cannot merge with red specs.

## What this does NOT catch

**The runner verifies that each spec ID has a registered test that asserts something. It does not verify that the spec is correct, complete, or that the user-facing feature actually works end to end.** Three specific failure modes survive a green gate:

### 1. Wrong spec

The spec entry says the scoring formula is `(ok / total) * 100`, the test asserts the same formula, both agree, the app ships with the wrong formula. Spec correctness is on the human reviewer; code review on spec changes is the mitigation.

### 2. Behavior not in the spec

You add a new server action without adding a spec entry. The gate has nothing to enforce against this new code. No automated check exists for "did you add a feature without a spec entry?" PR review discipline catches it.

### 3. Decomposed-journey gap

A user-facing feature whose implementation spans multiple spec IDs can hit 100% coverage while the **chain between IDs** is broken.

Real example from armoury:

| Spec ID | What it asserts | Passed? |
|---|---|---|
| ARM-PHOTO-001 | Officer submit page renders `<input type="file">` for items with `kind === "photo"` | ✅ |
| ARM-PHOTO-002 | A submitted photo persists as a data URL in `responses.valueText` | ✅ |
| ARM-PHOTO-003 | The submission detail page renders an `<img>` for photo responses | ✅ |
| **Untested** | **Admin builder dropdown offers Photo as a selectable item kind** | ❌ |

All three spec IDs passed. Coverage was 126/126. The photo feature was unreachable because no admin could ever create a template item of `kind === "photo"` — the builder's `<Select>` was missing the option. The gate was satisfied; the feature was broken.

**Mitigation:** for every user-facing feature, write at least one journey-level e2e that traverses the full path:

```ts
specTest(
  "APP-PHOTO-JOURNEY",
  "Admin creates photo item, officer uploads, admin sees the image",
  async ({ page }) => {
    await loginAsAdmin(page);
    await page.goto("/admin/templates/new");
    // ...fill name, add an item, select Photo from the kind dropdown
    await page.getByRole("combobox").nth(1).click();
    await page.getByRole("option", { name: "Photo" }).click();
    await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Create" }).click();

    await signOutAndLoginAsOfficer(page);
    await page.goto(`/officer/submit/${templateId}`);
    // ...upload a real PNG via the file input
    await page.setInputFiles('input[type="file"]', "tests/fixtures/sample.png");
    await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Submit" }).click();

    await signOutAndLoginAsAdmin(page);
    await page.goto(`/admin/submissions/${submissionId}`);
    await expect(page.locator('img[src^="data:image"]')).toBeVisible();
  },
  { category: "ui" },
);
```

The journey test asserts that the structure your individual spec IDs cover actually connects into a working chain. Without it, the gate measures structure only; with it, the gate measures behavior.

See `docs/TESTING.md` "Failure modes the gate does NOT catch" for the same caveat in the platform-wide context.

## Reading list

- `docs/TESTING.md` — full system overview (spec format, category routing, ESLint rule, CLI usage)
- `samples/example.spec.yml` — minimum viable spec for testing the runner
- `samples/bad.test.ts` — example of a test the ESLint rule blocks (zero `expect()` calls)

## Why this package is private

The platform copies, it does not import. Each app pins its own snapshot of `@platform/spec-test` from `packages/` rather than depending on a published version, so breaking changes never propagate without explicit action. See platform `README.md` "Opinions" for the philosophy.
