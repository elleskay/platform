# Deploy guide

Reference for deploying apps cloned from this platform. The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` automates everything below; this doc explains what it does and the gotchas the workflow handles for you.

## One-time AWS setup

### CDK bootstrap

```bash
npx cdk bootstrap aws://<account-id>/<region>
```

You only need this once per account+region. Bootstrap provisions the CDK toolkit stack (S3 staging bucket, ECR repo for container assets, IAM roles).

### OIDC role for GitHub Actions

1. In AWS IAM, add `token.actions.githubusercontent.com` as an OIDC provider.
2. Create a role with this trust policy (replace the GitHub path):

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": {
         "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<account>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
       },
       "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
       "Condition": {
         "StringEquals": {
           "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "StringLike": {
           "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:elleskay/my-app:*"
         }
       }
     }]
   }
   ```

3. Attach the policy from `infra/iam/cdk-deploy-policy.json` to this role.
4. Add the role ARN to GitHub Actions secrets as `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`.

### GitHub Actions secrets and variables

| Setting | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` | secret | OIDC role ARN |
| `DATABASE_URL` | secret | Postgres connection string |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | secret | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `AWS_REGION` | variable | e.g. `ap-southeast-1` |
| `APP_URL` | variable | Your CloudFront URL or custom domain |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | variable | CloudFront host + Lambda URL host, comma-separated |

### Optional (for the 5 wired helpers in apps/_template)

All five helpers no-op cleanly without their env vars, so omit any you don't use yet.

| Setting | Type | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `SENTRY_DSN` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | secret + variable | Sentry server + client |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | secret | Sentry source map upload (release build) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` | variable | PostHog analytics |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` | variable | Optional; default `https://us.i.posthog.com` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | secret | `lib/email.ts` |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | secrets | `lib/rate-limit.ts` |

## What the deploy does

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on push to `main`:

1. Checkout, install Node 20, restore npm cache.
2. Assume the OIDC role.
3. Install workspace dependencies (`npm ci`).
4. Apply DB migrations (`npx tsx db/migrate.ts` in `apps/web/`), conditional on `db/migrate.ts` existing. Runs **before** the new Lambda code goes live so the new code never references a column that hasn't been created yet.
5. Seed reference / demo data (`npx tsx db/seed-demo.ts` in `apps/web/`), conditional on `db/seed-demo.ts` existing. Must be idempotent. See `docs/variants/default-nextjs.md` "Seed strategy".
6. Build the Next.js app with OpenNext (`npm run build:open-next` in `apps/web/`). Env vars passed in: `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_URL`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
7. Install CDK deps (`npm ci` in `infra/cdk/app/`).
8. `cdk deploy --all` with the same env vars. CDK reads them at synth time and bakes them into the Lambda env.
9. Read the deployed URL from `cdk-outputs.json`.
10. Run `scripts/verify-deploy.sh` against that URL. Fails the workflow if any smoke check fails.

## Rollback

CDK does not auto-rollback on app-level failure. If a deploy ships broken code:

1. `git revert <bad-commit>` and push. The next deploy uses the previous CloudFormation state.
2. For data migrations, never run destructive operations in deploy. Use a separate one-off job with explicit approval.

## Gotchas baked into the platform

These all bit us in production. The platform encodes the fixes; do not undo them.

### 1. Server Actions reject CloudFront → Lambda forwarded requests

**Symptom:** Form submits hit "Invalid Server Actions request" because Next.js compares `x-forwarded-host` (Lambda URL) with `origin` (CloudFront).

**Fix:** `next.config.ts` reads `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` at build time and passes both hosts to `experimental.serverActions.allowedOrigins`. The pattern is in `apps/_template/next.config.ts`.

### 2. NextAuth redirects to the Lambda URL after login

**Symptom:** After login, browser URL becomes `https://xxx.lambda-url.<region>.on.aws/...` and CSS/static assets stop loading because S3 assets are only served via CloudFront.

**Fix:** Set `AUTH_URL` to the canonical CloudFront URL (or custom domain). The CDK construct sets this from the `AUTH_URL` prop. Set the GitHub variable `APP_URL` to your deployed URL.

### 3. Sign-out via server action fails to clear cookies

**Symptom:** Click sign out, page stays logged in. Lambda logs show 303 with `x-action-redirect` but no `Set-Cookie`.

**Fix:** Use `apps/_template/components/SignOutButton.tsx` which calls `signOut` from `next-auth/react`. That goes through `/api/auth/signout` which clears cookies correctly.

### 4. CDK env vars are baked at synth, not deploy

**Symptom:** You set `AUTH_URL` in `.env` file expecting Lambda to read it. Lambda has no `AUTH_URL` at runtime.

**Fix:** `cdk deploy` reads `process.env.*` when it synthesizes the stack. The CDK construct copies those into the Lambda's `environment`. Set env vars in the shell (or GitHub Actions `env:` block) that invokes `cdk deploy`.

### 5. OpenNext image-opt function won't build on Windows

**Symptom:** `ERROR Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdtemp 'C:\...\.open-next\image-optimization-functionXXXXXX'`.

**Fix:** Build on Linux/macOS/WSL. If you must build on Windows and your app uses no `next/image`, the deploy still works — the image function bundle is incomplete but never invoked.

### 6. `cdk bootstrap` fails if your stacks reference missing build assets

**Symptom:** `Cannot find asset at <path>/.open-next/assets`.

**Fix:** Run `open-next build` in `apps/web/` before any CDK command (including bootstrap), because `bin/app.ts` instantiates the stack on synth and the construct reads `.open-next/` paths.

### 7. First deploy needs two passes (or a custom domain)

**Symptom:** You don't know the CloudFront URL until after the first deploy completes. But the Lambda needs `AUTH_URL` set to that URL, and the Next.js build needs `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to include it. Chicken and egg.

**Fix (cheap):** Two-pass deploy.
1. First pass: build with `ALLOWED_ORIGINS="*.cloudfront.net,*.lambda-url.<region>.on.aws"` (wildcards work for `allowedOrigins`). Deploy with `AUTH_URL="https://placeholder.cloudfront.net"`. The deploy succeeds; auth callbacks would fail.
2. Read the CloudFront URL from `cdk-outputs.json`.
3. Second pass: redeploy with `AUTH_URL=<real CloudFront URL>`. No rebuild needed if the only change is Lambda env vars.

**Fix (better):** Use a custom domain. Pass `customDomain` to `NextjsServerless`:
```ts
new NextjsServerless(this, "Web", {
  appPath,
  environment: { AUTH_URL: "https://armoury.example.com", ... },
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "armoury.example.com",
    certificateArn: "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:...",
    hostedZoneId: "Z123...",
    hostedZoneName: "example.com",
  },
});
```
Now `AUTH_URL` is known up front. One-pass deploy.

### 8. Refactoring an existing stack into the construct changes the CloudFront URL

**Symptom:** You wrote raw CDK first, then refactored to use `NextjsServerless`. CDK plans REPLACE for CloudFront, S3, Lambda. Your URL changes and CloudFront takes 10-15 minutes to delete the old distribution.

**Fix:** Pass `logicalIdOverrides` to preserve CloudFormation logical IDs:
```ts
new NextjsServerless(this, "Web", {
  appPath,
  environment: { ... },
  logicalIdOverrides: {
    serverFunction: "ServerFunction6F3D7051",   // from the old template
    imageFunction: "ImageFunctionE28774B0",
    assetsBucket: "AssetsBucket5CB76180",
    distribution: "Distribution830FAC52",
  },
});
```
Find the existing IDs in your stack's `cdk synth` output (or in the AWS Console under CloudFormation, Resources tab) before the refactor. CDK then treats these as the same resources and updates in place.

If you're shipping a brand-new app, ignore this. Logical ID overrides only matter for in-place upgrades.

### 9. CloudFront deletes are slow

**Symptom:** `cdk deploy` blocks for 10-15 minutes after "UPDATE_COMPLETE" because CloudFormation is in `UPDATE_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS`, removing the old CloudFront distribution.

**Fix:** Not a bug, just AWS reality. CloudFront delete drains edge caches globally. New resources are already live before the cleanup finishes; you can verify with the new URL while CloudFormation drags. Use `logicalIdOverrides` (gotcha #8) to avoid the replace entirely.

### 10. Prod database missing rows even though the deploy succeeded

**Symptom:** You add a new template / inventory item / lookup row to `db/seed.ts`, push, CI green, deploy lands. Prod still doesn't have the row. Manual `psql` shows the row genuinely isn't there.

**Cause:** `db/seed.ts` is the dev/CI fixture seed. It runs only in `apps/_template/.github/workflows/test.yml` against the Postgres service container, never in prod, because it's destructive (`db.delete(...)` everything before reseeding). Running it on prod would wipe user data.

**Fix:** Split the seed into two files. Keep `db/seed.ts` for the destructive dev/CI fixture. Add `db/seed-demo.ts` for prod-safe reference data: every row looked up by natural key (`email` for users, `name+agency` for teams, `externalRef` for inventory) and inserted only if missing. Wire it into `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` as a conditional step right after the migrate step. Reruns on every deploy are no-ops because every row has a stable lookup.

See `docs/variants/default-nextjs.md` "Seed strategy" for the full pattern (including `ensureX` helpers and the `DEMO_ANCHOR` constant for deterministic synthetic activity). Anchored to Rollback rule above ("never run destructive operations in deploy"): seed-demo respects that by design.

### 11. Every request hits Lambda; "Rate Exceeded" on low-concurrency accounts

**Symptom:** Pages intermittently return `{"Reason":"ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded","message":"Rate Exceeded"}`, especially on a fresh AWS account (default Lambda concurrency can be as low as 10). A single page load can fan out several invocations because Next.js prefetches linked routes.

**Cause:** The construct's default CloudFront behavior uses `CACHING_DISABLED`, so the HTML/RSC responses are never cached at the edge. Every visit and every prefetch goes to the server Lambda. That is the safe default for auth/SSR apps (never cache a personalized response) but wasteful and fragile for static/SSG-heavy apps.

**Fix:** Two levers, use either or both.
1. App level: set `prefetch={false}` on `next/link` to stop the prefetch fan-out (cheapest mitigation).
2. Construct level: for a content/SSG app, pass `defaultCachePolicy` to `NextjsServerless` with a policy that honours origin `Cache-Control` (minTtl 0), so cacheable pages cache at CloudFront while dynamic routes (which Next marks `no-store`) stay uncached. See the `defaultCachePolicy` prop docs in `NextjsServerless.ts`.
3. Or request a Lambda concurrency limit increase for the account.

## Environments

Default: `production`. Add `staging` by:

1. Creating a separate GitHub environment with its own secrets/vars (different `APP_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc).
2. Choosing it via `workflow_dispatch` from the Actions tab, or adding a separate workflow that triggers on a `staging` branch.

For real multi-environment, deploy each to a separate AWS account.

## Cost expectations

For a typical portfolio app with negligible traffic:

| Resource | Monthly |
|---|---|
| Lambda invocations + duration (Free Tier covers 1M req + 400k GB-s) | $0 |
| S3 storage (~50 MB) + GET requests | <$0.10 |
| CloudFront transfer (Free Tier covers 1TB) | $0 |
| CloudWatch Logs | ~$0.50 |
| **Total realistic idle** | **<$1** |

At 100k requests/day you're still well within Free Tier. The Lambda + CloudFront pattern is genuinely cheap at low scale.
