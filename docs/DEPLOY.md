# Deploy guide

Reference for deploying apps cloned from this platform. The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` automates everything below; this doc explains what it does and the gotchas the workflow handles for you.

## One-time AWS setup

### CDK bootstrap

```bash
npx cdk bootstrap aws://<account-id>/<region>
```

You only need this once per account+region. Bootstrap provisions the CDK toolkit stack (S3 staging bucket, ECR repo for container assets, IAM roles).

### OIDC role for GitHub Actions

1. In AWS IAM, add `token.actions.githubusercontent.com` as an OIDC provider.
2. Create a role with this trust policy (replace the GitHub path):

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": {
         "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<account>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
       },
       "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
       "Condition": {
         "StringEquals": {
           "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "StringLike": {
           "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:elleskay/my-app:*"
         }
       }
     }]
   }
   ```

3. Attach the policy from `infra/iam/cdk-deploy-policy.json` to this role.
4. Add the role ARN to GitHub Actions secrets as `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`.

### GitHub Actions secrets and variables

| Setting | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` | secret | OIDC role ARN |
| `DATABASE_URL` | secret | Postgres connection string |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | secret | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `AWS_REGION` | variable | e.g. `ap-southeast-1` |
| `APP_URL` | variable | Your CloudFront URL or custom domain |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | variable | CloudFront host + Lambda URL host, comma-separated |

### Optional (for the 5 wired helpers in apps/_template)

All five helpers no-op cleanly without their env vars, so omit any you don't use yet.

| Setting | Type | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `SENTRY_DSN` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | secret + variable | Sentry server + client |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | secret | Sentry source map upload (release build) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` | variable | PostHog analytics |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` | variable | Optional; default `https://us.i.posthog.com` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | secret | `lib/email.ts` |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | secrets | `lib/rate-limit.ts` |

## What the deploy does

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on push to `main`:

1. Checkout, install Node 22, restore npm cache.
2. Assume the OIDC role.
3. Install workspace dependencies (`npm ci`).
4. Apply DB migrations (`npx tsx db/migrate.ts` in `apps/web/`), conditional on `db/migrate.ts` existing. Runs **before** the new Lambda code goes live so the new code never references a column that hasn't been created yet.
5. Seed reference / demo data (`npx tsx db/seed-demo.ts` in `apps/web/`), conditional on `db/seed-demo.ts` existing. Must be idempotent. See `docs/variants/default-nextjs.md` "Seed strategy".
6. Build the Next.js app with OpenNext (`npm run build:open-next` in `apps/web/`). Env vars passed in: `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_URL`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
7. Install CDK deps (`npm ci` in the CDK dir (default `infra/cdk/_template`)).
8. `cdk deploy --all` with the same env vars. CDK reads them at synth time and bakes them into the Lambda env.
9. Read the deployed URL from `cdk-outputs.json`.
10. Run `scripts/verify-deploy.sh` against that URL. Fails the workflow if any smoke check fails.

## Rollback

CDK does not auto-rollback on app-level failure. If a deploy ships broken code:

1. `git revert <bad-commit>` and push. The next deploy uses the previous CloudFormation state.
2. For data migrations, never run destructive operations in deploy. Use a separate one-off job with explicit approval.

## Gotchas baked into the platform

These all bit us in production. The platform encodes the fixes; do not undo them.

### 1. Server Actions reject CloudFront → Lambda forwarded requests

**Symptom:** Form submits hit "Invalid Server Actions request" because Next.js compares `x-forwarded-host` (Lambda URL) with `origin` (CloudFront).

**Fix:** `next.config.ts` reads `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` at build time and passes both hosts to `experimental.serverActions.allowedOrigins`. The pattern is in `apps/_template/next.config.ts`.

### 2. NextAuth redirects to the Lambda URL after login

**Symptom:** After login, browser URL becomes `https://xxx.lambda-url.<region>.on.aws/...` and CSS/static assets stop loading because S3 assets are only served via CloudFront.

**Fix:** Set `AUTH_URL` to the canonical CloudFront URL (or custom domain). The CDK construct sets this from the `AUTH_URL` prop. Set the GitHub variable `APP_URL` to your deployed URL.

### 3. Sign-out via server action fails to clear cookies

**Symptom:** Click sign out, page stays logged in. Lambda logs show 303 with `x-action-redirect` but no `Set-Cookie`.

**Fix:** Use `apps/_template/components/SignOutButton.tsx` which calls `signOut` from `next-auth/react`. That goes through `/api/auth/signout` which clears cookies correctly.

### 4. CDK env vars are baked at synth, not deploy

**Symptom:** You set `AUTH_URL` in `.env` file expecting Lambda to read it. Lambda has no `AUTH_URL` at runtime.

**Fix:** `cdk deploy` reads `process.env.*` when it synthesizes the stack. The CDK construct copies those into the Lambda's `environment`. Set env vars in the shell (or GitHub Actions `env:` block) that invokes `cdk deploy`.

### 5. OpenNext image-opt function won't build on Windows

**Symptom:** `ERROR Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdtemp 'C:\...\.open-next\image-optimization-functionXXXXXX'`.

**Fix:** Build on Linux/macOS/WSL. If you must build on Windows and your app uses no `next/image`, the deploy still works — the image function bundle is incomplete but never invoked.

### 6. `cdk bootstrap` fails if your stacks reference missing build assets

**Symptom:** `Cannot find asset at <path>/.open-next/assets`.

**Fix:** Run `open-next build` in `apps/web/` before any CDK command (including bootstrap), because `bin/app.ts` instantiates the stack on synth and the construct reads `.open-next/` paths.

### 7. First deploy needs two passes (or a custom domain)

**Symptom:** You don't know the CloudFront URL until after the first deploy completes. But the Lambda needs `AUTH_URL` set to that URL, and the Next.js build needs `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to include it. Chicken and egg.

**Fix (cheap):** Two-pass deploy.
1. First pass: build with `ALLOWED_ORIGINS="*.cloudfront.net,*.lambda-url.<region>.on.aws"` (wildcards work for `allowedOrigins`). Deploy with `AUTH_URL="https://placeholder.cloudfront.net"`. The deploy succeeds; auth callbacks would fail.
2. Read the CloudFront URL from `cdk-outputs.json`.
3. Second pass: redeploy with `AUTH_URL=<real CloudFront URL>`. No rebuild needed if the only change is Lambda env vars.

**Fix (better):** Use a custom domain. Pass `customDomain` to `NextjsServerless`:
```ts
new NextjsServerless(this, "Web", {
  appPath,
  environment: { AUTH_URL: "https://armoury.example.com", ... },
  customDomain: {
    domainName: "armoury.example.com",
    certificateArn: "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:...",
    hostedZoneId: "Z123...",
    hostedZoneName: "example.com",
  },
});
```
Now `AUTH_URL` is known up front. One-pass deploy.

### 8. Refactoring an existing stack into the construct changes the CloudFront URL

**Symptom:** You wrote raw CDK first, then refactored to use `NextjsServerless`. CDK plans REPLACE for CloudFront, S3, Lambda. Your URL changes and CloudFront takes 10-15 minutes to delete the old distribution.

**Fix:** Pass `logicalIdOverrides` to preserve CloudFormation logical IDs:
```ts
new NextjsServerless(this, "Web", {
  appPath,
  environment: { ... },
  logicalIdOverrides: {
    serverFunction: "ServerFunction6F3D7051",   // from the old template
    imageFunction: "ImageFunctionE28774B0",
    assetsBucket: "AssetsBucket5CB76180",
    distribution: "Distribution830FAC52",
  },
});
```
Find the existing IDs in your stack's `cdk synth` output (or in the AWS Console under CloudFormation, Resources tab) before the refactor. CDK then treats these as the same resources and updates in place.

If you're shipping a brand-new app, ignore this. Logical ID overrides only matter for in-place upgrades.

### 9. CloudFront deletes are slow

**Symptom:** `cdk deploy` blocks for 10-15 minutes after "UPDATE_COMPLETE" because CloudFormation is in `UPDATE_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS`, removing the old CloudFront distribution.

**Fix:** Not a bug, just AWS reality. CloudFront delete drains edge caches globally. New resources are already live before the cleanup finishes; you can verify with the new URL while CloudFormation drags. Use `logicalIdOverrides` (gotcha #8) to avoid the replace entirely.

### 10. Prod database missing rows even though the deploy succeeded

**Symptom:** You add a new template / inventory item / lookup row to `db/seed.ts`, push, CI green, deploy lands. Prod still doesn't have the row. Manual `psql` shows the row genuinely isn't there.

**Cause:** `db/seed.ts` is the dev/CI fixture seed. It runs only in `apps/_template/.github/workflows/test.yml` against the Postgres service container, never in prod, because it's destructive (`db.delete(...)` everything before reseeding). Running it on prod would wipe user data.

**Fix:** Split the seed into two files. Keep `db/seed.ts` for the destructive dev/CI fixture. Add `db/seed-demo.ts` for prod-safe reference data: every row looked up by natural key (`email` for users, `name+agency` for teams, `externalRef` for inventory) and inserted only if missing. Wire it into `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` as a conditional step right after the migrate step. Reruns on every deploy are no-ops because every row has a stable lookup.

See `docs/variants/default-nextjs.md` "Seed strategy" for the full pattern (including `ensureX` helpers and the `DEMO_ANCHOR` constant for deterministic synthetic activity). Anchored to Rollback rule above ("never run destructive operations in deploy"): seed-demo respects that by design.

### 11. Every request hits Lambda; "Rate Exceeded" on low-concurrency accounts

**Symptom:** Pages intermittently return `{"Reason":"ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded","message":"Rate Exceeded"}`, especially on a fresh AWS account (default Lambda concurrency can be as low as 10). A single page load can fan out several invocations because Next.js prefetches linked routes.

**Cause:** The construct's default CloudFront behavior uses `CACHING_DISABLED`, so the HTML/RSC responses are never cached at the edge. Every visit and every prefetch goes to the server Lambda. That is the safe default for auth/SSR apps (never cache a personalized response) but wasteful and fragile for static/SSG-heavy apps.

**Fix:** Two levers, use either or both.
1. App level: set `prefetch={false}` on `next/link` to stop the prefetch fan-out (cheapest mitigation).
2. Construct level: for a content/SSG app, pass `defaultCachePolicy` to `NextjsServerless` with a policy that honours origin `Cache-Control` (minTtl 0), so cacheable pages cache at CloudFront while dynamic routes (which Next marks `no-store`) stay uncached. See the `defaultCachePolicy` prop docs in `NextjsServerless.ts`.
3. Or request a Lambda concurrency limit increase for the account.

### 12. A file in `public/` returns 404 in production

**Symptom:** A static file you put in the app's `public/` folder (for example `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `manifest.json`, an OG image, or a web worker) loads fine with `next start` but returns a 404 from the server Lambda once deployed.

**Cause:** OpenNext copies `public/` to the assets bucket root, but CloudFront only forwarded a fixed set of paths to S3. Everything else fell through to the server Lambda, which has no route for arbitrary public files.

**Fix:** The construct now reads `.open-next/assets` at synth time and adds an S3 behavior for every top-level public entry (a file becomes `/<file>`, a folder becomes `/<folder>/*`), so all public assets are served from S3 automatically. Notes: the build output must exist before synth (gotcha #6, the workflow already orders this), and CloudFront allows 25 cache behaviors per distribution by default, so keep many public files inside folders rather than dozens at the root. If you author a bundled asset (e.g. a pdf.js worker), prefer `new URL("pkg/worker.mjs", import.meta.url)` so it lands under `/_next/static` rather than relying on a root `public/` file.

### 13. An app-specific runtime secret (e.g. an AI key) is empty in production

**Symptom:** A route that needs an env var the platform does not ship by default (an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, a third-party API key, a feature flag) works locally but returns 503 / behaves as unconfigured once deployed, even though you set the value as a GitHub secret or variable.

**Cause:** The deploy workflow only forwards the platform's own env (`DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_URL`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`) into the build and CDK steps, and the construct only bakes those into the Lambda. A GitHub secret that nothing reads never reaches the function. Remember env is baked at synth (gotcha #4), so it must be present during `cdk deploy`, not just at runtime.

**Fix:** Wire the new var in **both** places. (1) In your app's CDK stack (`infra/cdk/<app>/lib/web-stack.ts`) add it to the construct's `environment: {}` so it is baked into the Lambda. (2) In `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, add it to the `env:` of the **CDK deploy** step (`MY_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_KEY }}` or `${{ vars.MY_KEY }}`). Setting it only as a repo secret/variable is not enough. After deploy, `curl` the live endpoint to confirm the value actually reached the Lambda; a green deploy does not prove the env was wired.

> Non-auth apps: the post-deploy smoke test auto-detects a public app (root returns 200 instead of redirecting to `/login`) and skips the auth-only checks, so you do not need to edit `scripts/verify-deploy.sh` for a public single-page app.

### 14. A slow route fails in production after ~30 seconds

**Symptom:** A route that runs slow work (a multi-pass LLM call, a large export, a heavy query) works locally but returns a 502/504 or a generic "failed" once deployed, especially on larger inputs. It often looks intermittent because it only trips when the work crosses ~30s.

**Cause:** The construct defaults the server Lambda timeout and the CloudFront origin read timeout to **30 seconds**. A Next.js route `export const maxDuration = 60` is only a hint and does **not** change the CDK-set Lambda timeout, so the request is killed at 30s regardless.

**Fix:** Pass `serverTimeoutSeconds` to the `NextjsServerless` construct in your app's `web-stack.ts` (it raises both the Lambda timeout and the CloudFront read timeout together). CloudFront allows up to 60 without a quota increase:

```ts
new NextjsServerless(this, "Web", {
  appPath: ...,
  serverTimeoutSeconds: 60, // for AI / long-running routes
  environment: { ... },
});
```

For work that genuinely needs longer than 60s, move it off the request path (a queue/async job) rather than holding the HTTP connection open.

### 15. First deploy stalls (or times out) on the S3 asset upload

**Symptom:** CloudFront finishes, but the stack sits in `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` for 15+ minutes on `AssetsDeployment` (`Custom::CDKBucketDeployment`). The deployment Lambda logs show the upload crawling at tens of KiB/s, and it can eventually time out and roll back.

**Cause:** `BucketDeployment` defaults its uploader Lambda to **128 MB**, and Lambda network bandwidth scales with memory. A Next.js build is hundreds of small chunk files, and at 128 MB the copy is too slow to finish inside the Lambda timeout.

**Fix:** The construct now sets `memoryLimit: 1536` on `AssetsDeployment`, so the upload finishes in a minute or two. If you ever hit this on an already-running deploy, bump the live function in place and let the retry pick it up, no full redeploy needed:

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name <stack>-CustomCDKBucketDeployment... \
  --memory-size 1536
```

## Environments

Default: `production`. Add `staging` by:

1. Creating a separate GitHub environment with its own secrets/vars (different `APP_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc).
2. Choosing it via `workflow_dispatch` from the Actions tab, or adding a separate workflow that triggers on a `staging` branch.

For real multi-environment, deploy each to a separate AWS account.

## Cost expectations

For a typical portfolio app with negligible traffic:

| Resource | Monthly |
|---|---|
| Lambda invocations + duration (Free Tier covers 1M req + 400k GB-s) | $0 |
| S3 storage (~50 MB) + GET requests | <$0.10 |
| CloudFront transfer (Free Tier covers 1TB) | $0 |
| CloudWatch Logs | ~$0.50 |
| **Total realistic idle** | **<$1** |

At 100k requests/day you're still well within Free Tier. The Lambda + CloudFront pattern is genuinely cheap at low scale.
