# Theming and visual identity per app

The platform ships shared primitives (`StatCard`, `EmptyState`, `PageHeader`, `ThemeProvider`, `ThemeToggle`) so apps don't redo the same UI plumbing. But each app should have its own **visual identity** so portfolio readers see distinct products, not 6 cloned demos.

What's shared, what's per-app:

| Shared (don't override per app) | Per-app (always pick) |
|---|---|
| Component APIs and behaviour | Brand color (primary) |
| Layout primitives (cards, badges, dialogs) | Logo + lucide icon for header |
| Theme variable shape | Tagline / wordmark |
| Dark mode toggle | Sidebar items + ordering |
| StatCard structure | Dashboard composition |
| EmptyState pattern | Domain-specific widgets (BookingCalendar, ChatThread, etc.) |

## Pick a brand color

The primary color drives the sidebar accent, primary buttons, focus ring, and Chart-1. Set it in `apps/web/app/globals.css` as an OKLCH value.

Examples by product domain:

| Domain | Color | OKLCH |
|---|---|---|
| Frontline safety | Safety orange | `oklch(0.62 0.21 35)` |
| Health appointments | Healthcare teal | `oklch(0.62 0.14 200)` |
| Fraud alerts | Alert red | `oklch(0.58 0.22 25)` |
| Community | Warm gold | `oklch(0.72 0.16 80)` |
| Sports and fitness | Energetic green | `oklch(0.65 0.18 145)` |
| Official comms | Trust blue | `oklch(0.55 0.18 250)` |
| Traffic and transport | Authoritative navy | `oklch(0.45 0.15 250)` |

Pick once per app. Override `--primary`, `--primary-foreground`, `--ring`, `--sidebar-primary`, `--sidebar-ring`, `--chart-1` in both `:root` and `.dark` blocks.

## Pick a sidebar identity

Each app's sidebar shows a small icon + the app name + a tagline:

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 px-2 py-3">
  <div className="flex h-8 w-8 items-center justify-center rounded-md bg-primary text-primary-foreground">
    <Shield className="h-4 w-4" />     {/* Pick a different lucide icon per app */}
  </div>
  <div className="flex flex-col">
    <span className="text-sm font-semibold">Armoury</span>     {/* App name */}
    <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Frontline ops</span>  {/* Tagline */}
  </div>
</div>
```

Suggested icon per app:
- Armoury → `Shield`
- HAS → `CalendarHeart`
- ScamShield → `ShieldAlert`
- KampungSpirit → `HandHeart`
- ActiveSG → `Trophy` or `Dumbbell`
- Postman → `Send`
- TEALS → `Car`

## Pick a layout shell

Most apps benefit from the sidebar pattern in `AppSidebar.tsx`. Some don't.

| Layout | Use when |
|---|---|
| **Sidebar** (admin-heavy apps) | Many sections, persistent user state, internal tool feel. Armoury, TEALS, ActiveSG admin. |
| **Top-nav** (citizen-facing wizards) | Linear flow, mobile-first, marketing-style hero. HAS booking, ScamShield report submission. |
| **Hybrid** (sidebar for admin, top-nav for public) | Apps with both admin and public surfaces. Postman, ActiveSG. |

Don't force the sidebar everywhere. The point of the platform is *consistent primitives*, not *identical layouts*.

## Pick dashboard composition

`StatCard` is universal but what cards each app shows is per-app:

| App | Dashboard cards |
|---|---|
| Armoury | Total submissions, Last 14d, Compliance %, Open issues |
| HAS | Today's appointments, No-show rate, Slot utilisation, Upcoming clinics |
| ScamShield | Reports/day, Classifier confidence, Resolved/unresolved, Top scam types |
| ActiveSG | Active bookings, Revenue this month, Programme fill rate, No-show rate |
| Postman | Emails sent today, Open rate, Bounce rate, Active campaigns |

Same `StatCard` primitive, different data, different story.

## What this gets you

Six apps that **feel like a family** (same components, same interactions, same dark mode toggle, same empty states) but **read as distinct products** (different colors, layouts, icons, taglines, dashboard cards). That's the right portfolio signal: "I designed a platform AND distinct products on top of it."
