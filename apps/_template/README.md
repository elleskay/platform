# apps/_template — reference overlay files

Files you copy into a new app on first scaffold. They encode the production patterns this platform discovered the hard way.

## What's here

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `next.config.ts` | Security headers + Server Actions `allowedOrigins` (read from `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env at build time) |
| `auth.config.ts` | Edge-safe NextAuth config for middleware (no DB calls) |
| `middleware.ts` | Auth-only middleware that reads `auth.config.ts` |
| `components/SignOutButton.tsx` | Client component for signout (server-action signout doesn't clear cookies on OpenNext) |
| `sentry.client.config.ts`, `sentry.server.config.ts`, `sentry.edge.config.ts`, `instrumentation.ts` | Sentry wiring. No-ops without `SENTRY_DSN` |
| `components/PostHogProvider.tsx` | PostHog analytics provider. No-ops without `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` |
| `components/Toaster.tsx` | Sonner toast root. Mount once in layout. |
| `lib/email.ts` | Resend helper. No-ops without `RESEND_API_KEY` |
| `lib/rate-limit.ts` | Upstash Redis rate-limit factory. No-ops without `UPSTASH_REDIS_*` |
| `components/forms-README.md` | Doc on the two valid form patterns; install RHF per app if you want pattern B |

## Why each one exists

Each fixes a bug or removes friction we hit on real deploys. See `docs/DEPLOY.md` for the production gotchas.

- `allowedOrigins` from env → fixes "Invalid Server Actions request" when CloudFront forwards to Lambda
- `auth.config.ts` separate from `auth.ts` → middleware runs on Edge runtime and can't import DB client
- Client-side `SignOutButton` → server-side `signOut` doesn't clear cookies through OpenNext's Lambda streaming
- Sentry/PostHog/Sonner/Resend/Upstash → universal-enough that pre-wiring saves every app from rebuilding the same plumbing

## How to use

When scaffolding a new app:

```bash
# 1. Create the Next.js app shell
npx create-next-app@latest apps/web --typescript --tailwind --app --eslint

# 2. Overlay these reference files (everything in _template except this README and forms-README.md)
cp -r ../_template/. apps/web/
rm apps/web/README.md apps/web/components/forms-README.md

# 3. Install runtime deps
cd apps/web
npm install next-auth@beta zod
npm install @opennextjs/aws
npm install @sentry/nextjs posthog-js posthog-node sonner resend @upstash/ratelimit @upstash/redis
```

Then write your own `auth.ts` that imports `auth.config.ts` and adds the provider (Credentials, OAuth, whatever fits).

## What this template does NOT include

- Auth providers — your app picks
- Database schema or ORM — your app picks
- UI components beyond signout + toast root — your app picks
- React Hook Form — see `components/forms-README.md` for the trade-off; install per app
- Page layouts and routes — your app picks

This is the minimal shell + universal infrastructure. Everything else is product code.
